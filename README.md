# ** mkdir backslash **

 The origin of this program was to convert the file names of an
 erroneously zipped program. It used backslashes instead of
 forward slashes, so they unzipped as files only,
 no directories. You can use this program to take those files
 and fix the output into the correct result.

 Usage:
 **--no-delete**: If the input files and output files are the same area, the input files will be automatically deleted, passing this flag prevents that
 **-r, --recursive**: Recursively descends subdirectories
 **-d <string>, --output-dir <string>, --output-directory <string>**: Sets output location [**CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED**]
